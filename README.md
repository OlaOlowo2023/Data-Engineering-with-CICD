# End-to-End Data Engineering Project

This End-to-End Data Engineering Project focuses on designing, building, and deploying a complete data pipeline that transforms raw data into actionable insights. The project covers the full lifecycle of data engineering, including data ingestion, storage, processing, transformation, and visualization.

The pipeline begins with extracting data from diverse sources (e.g., APIs, databases, or files), followed by data cleansing and transformation using tools such as Apache Spark or SQL. Processed data is then loaded into a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, or Amazon Redshift) for efficient querying and analytics. Automation and orchestration are implemented using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect to ensure reliability and scalability.

The final component of the project includes building dashboards or reports using BI tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Looker to enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. Throughout the project, best practices in data modeling, version control, security, and monitoring are applied to ensure a robust and maintainable architecture.

## Instructions
This repository has two branches: `main` holds the initial state of the project, and `finished` holds the final state. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
You will be working in the `main` branch throughout the course. At any time, you can checkout the `finished` branch to consult how the finished project looks like.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. If not, you can download and install it from Python's official website.
